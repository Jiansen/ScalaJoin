# Another Scala Join Library

## Repository Migration
This project is previously published at my previous [Edinburgh University homepage](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1024484/join/), which might be removed at any time.   The project is migrated to Github so that it is easier

## Project Summary

This project improves Dr. Philipp Haller's [Scala Joins Library](http://lamp.epfl.ch/~phaller/joins/index.html) by:
- providing uniform and operator
- supporting pattern matching on messages
- supporting theoretically unlimited numbers of join patterns in a single join definition
- using simpler structure for the Join class
- supporting communications on distributed join channels

Comments on the current library, its manual, and examples will be appreciated.

## Version history
- 0.3.0:  This is the first version available on GitHub.
